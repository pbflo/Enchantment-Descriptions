# Potion-Descriptions 
#### **Forked from [Enchantment Descriptions](https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Enchantment-Descriptions)**
Display descriptions about a potion effect in the tooltip.

## Adding support

This mod uses a simple format for potion descriptions. You can add support for this mod and others using the format by adding a translation key to your language file. The format is `potion.MODID.EFFECTNAME.desc=`.

### There is now also another mod that does the same thing...
I found it while looking for a fix to a problem I had.
Well, I guess this one here is even more irrelevant now...
